A standalone GUI utility to unzip zip archives found in a user-provided folder.  The tool will iterate throught the directory structure to find zip files and nested zip files.

Archives are unpacked in the same directory where the parent archive file was found to preserve relevant file structures. 

This was designed for legal productions that are difficult to deal with.  As such it is assumed the user is only working with duplicate data when using this tool. DO NOT RUN THIS ON ORIGINAL/UNDUPLICATED DATA.

Initial version only supports unencrypted archives.
